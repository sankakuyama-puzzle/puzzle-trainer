An interactive 3D visualization tool for the Tetra Ludens and Sankakuyama puzzles. Master the complex spatial logic of 18-sided chamfered cube geometries through customizable 3D playback.

Sankakuyama / Tetra Ludens Image Trainer
Sankakuyama / Tetra Ludens Image Trainer is a web-based 3D visualization tool designed for enthusiasts of high-difficulty polyhedral puzzles.
Solving the Tetra Ludens (14 unique pieces) and the Sankakuyama (Pyramid) puzzles typically requires 30 minutes to an hour of intense concentration. This "Image Trainer" is crafted to help beginners and experts alike develop the spatial intuition needed to conquer these challenges.
Key Features
Mathematical Precision: Accurate representation of the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice and 18-sided Chamfered Cube geometries.
Interactive Visualization: Rotate the assembly 360 degrees and zoom in to inspect the intricate internal structures from any angle.
Customizable Playback:
Speed Control: Switch between Normal, Slow, and Super Slow modes to observe exactly how each piece interlocks.
Filtered Random Playback: Focus your training on specific puzzle types (Mixed, Tetra Ludens, or Sankakuyama).
Realistic Aesthetics: Features a digital twin of the original wooden base with stable vertex sockets for an authentic tactile feel.
Controls
[R] Key: Cycle through random playback filters (Mixed → Tetra → Sankakuyama).
[S] Key: Toggle assembly speed (Normal → Slow → Super Slow).
Mouse Drag: Rotate the view.
Mouse Wheel: Zoom in and out.
Purpose
This tool serves as a "mental blueprint" to bridge the gap between physical puzzle pieces and their complex geometric solutions. Use it as a study guide, a solving aid, or simply to appreciate the mathematical beauty of these puzzles.
